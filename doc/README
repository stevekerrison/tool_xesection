Usage: xesection xefile [n]

Without n specified a list of discovered sections, their types and lengths
will be printed.

With n specified, the section block (including its header), at index n will
be output to stdout.

This can then be inserted into xefile. It's header and CRC are unchanged and
so still valid.

Also included for your programming pleasure is xebuilder.py, which can
turn the sections produced by xesection back into xe files that can be
run in xrun.
