Usage: xesection xefile [n]

Without n specified a list of discovered sections, their types and lengths
will be printed.

With n specified, the section block (including its header), at index n will
be output to stdout.

This can then be inserted into xefile. It's header and CRC are unchanged and
so still valid.
